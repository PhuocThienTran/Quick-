# Quick+
Quick+ can be your friend right from the moment when you open your eyes in the morning to when you close them at night. The app will ask you a series of set questions, ranging from the wellbeing of your body to the comfort of your environment, and then will provide you the essentials to help boost your mind's positivity. At your fingertips, Quick Apps will provide you the very best nearby restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide through Yelp's services to provide you one of the finest ways for you to get out of the house and dine at the local's favourite restaurant choice, however, if you're not a foodie Quick Apps will provide you the most reliable navigation tool - used by us in all of our apps, to allow you to plan a full day of adventures and physical activities with your closest friends. So set aside a few minutes of your time and answer honestly so we can assist you in reducing anything that might be pulling you down.

## This app would not have been possible without the efforts of Ishini Tennakoon as Quick Apps co-founder, and Brittney Truong as Quick+'s graphic designer.
